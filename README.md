# learn_web
This isn't a project, this is just me trying to learn some design, maybe interface some API... and if I get really good, then I guess I should check out back-end development.

## How?
I will be using these traditional web-development tools first: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Later on, I might try SASS and JQUERY

## Why?
My design skills are worthless, also these aren't really projects, more like gists, so I can finish them fast.

## What else?
- Remind me to not get too cozy with web-development because there are more important things than it, like higher mathematics, systems design, and people I guess.
- Improve my own speed: If JavaScript isn't faster than Adobe products and other click-and-design tools, then what is the point in coding at all?
- Improve readability: By strategically layering designs/categories, it should be possible to focus a person on particular points of a webpage and to more quickly transmit information (because they know where to look)
- The previous two could include learning git. So learn git.
- Learn more about VScode/electronJS.
- Figure out if the new abstracted OOP is actually an improvement on what OOP actually is, or if it has a future in my tool set.
