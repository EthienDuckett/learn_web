# learn_web
This is a project which I will recommence to test my web development skills.
It is a collection of static web pages as of now, but that may be subject to change.
You can find the live pages at: https://ethienduckett.github.io/learn_web/.
This project will be error-prone or perhaps anti-UX in some cases. It is unintentional except for pages like "tunnel vision" where the black screen and white light fit the theme. I don't plan on fixing the errors, I think I will just add more projects and sort them in order of impressiveness on the index.html page(s).

## sidenotes
I might not be ready to commit to this project yet because I have a lot of other priorities.
