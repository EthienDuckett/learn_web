	<h1>It's a new day</h1>
	<h2>I'm exhausted</h2>
	<p>I lost what feels like an hour of sleep last night.</p>
	<p>No longer exhausted, I just drank some hot apple cider--it almost burned by tongue. Also, I am going to sleep after this.</p>
	<h2>I'm burdened with school</h2>
	<p>I don't want to go into details--just know that it consumes anywhere from 38-50 hours of my life each week. Actually, there is one detail that I would like to divulge: I used to be a procrastinator mostly because I was a perfectionist and if I couldn't make something perfect then I wouldn't make it or finish it, well that is changing, I am giving the school what they want now, which evidently is just low-quality work with no real use or application. :)</p>
	<h2>Going somewhere</h2>
	<p>I was exhausted because I watched about 14 hours of documentaries yesterday. I really tortured myself because I only watched documentaries about corruption. I will try to be back tomorrow.</p>
