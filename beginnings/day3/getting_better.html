	<h1>Git and My FACE!</h1>
	<div id="my_face">
		<p>For the past 3 days, my face has been quite swollen. I developed a rash, probably from the acne treatment I recently started, and it spread to my eyes and arms just two days ago.</p>
		<ul>
			<caption>Currently I know the following:</caption>
			<li>ABSOLUTELY NOTHING--except that it feels better than yesterday</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div id="git">
		<p>Today I spent a fair amount of time researching git, and what I found was that git is better than I originally thought.</p>
		<ul>
			<caption>I recently learned the following:</caption>
			<li>What the origin ref is</li>
			<li>What a 'ref' is</li>
			<li>What upstream and downstream actually entail</li>
			<li>How to do a 3-way merge</li>
			<li>When to use a branch (I think by merging the git-tests branch into the main branch, I may have broken some unspoken rules.)</li>
			<li>How to manipulate commits</li>
			<li>Difference between git branch heads and HEAD/ORIG_HEAD</li>
			<li>More about tags</li>
			<li>I learned something about git stash</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<h2 id="break">... even so, I am still bad at design</p>
